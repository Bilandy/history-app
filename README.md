This essay will further elaborate on how I went about developing an Android Application which functions as a digital resource, furnishing users with details regarding noteworthy historical figures and their respective death dates. The primary purpose of this app is to offer a convenient way for users to access historical data and learn about the passing of influential individuals throughout history. Users can type a specific digit or age, which will quickly access information about the individual’s age. In my project, I encountered various challenges, especially when it came to implementing the functionalities of my application. Despite paying attention in class and diligently trying to keep up, I found myself grappling with unfamiliar concepts.  

However, with persistence and the aid of online resources, I gradually overcame these hurdles. Initially, I focused on integrating an image into my design. While my buttons were already designed and declared, the addition of the image posed a new challenge. I then turned to YouTube tutorials for guidance, but the instructions were not always clear. After several attempts, I finally grasped the process on a Thursday afternoon. With the image successfully incorporated into my project, I shifted my attention to the clear button.  

Although the clear button was visible on the user interface, it lacked functionality. I sought out another tutorial to understand how to implement its clearing feature. Despite the lack of clear instructions in the video, I managed to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. Subsequently, the clear button seamlessly cleared the designated field on the age input section. The most daunting task was ensuring the functionality of the submit button, which served as the core feature of the application. 

This required linking the button and the text view to work cohesively, displaying relevant information when I input the age. Fortunately, the instructions in the tutorial simplified the process, emphasizing the importance of establishing a connection between the button and the text view to trigger the desired output. In terms of the design, I envisioned a serene backdrop for the user interface, characterized by a tranquil blue sky adorned with soft, billowing clouds. The buttons, distinguished by their regal purple hue, provided a striking contrast against the azure canvas. This design choice aimed to evoke a sense of calm and simplicity, enhancing the user experience.  

The challenges I faced during the development of my application have only strengthened my resolve to pursue excellence in all my endeavours, and I look forward to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead in the ever-evolving world of technology. Expanding upon the challenges encountered during the development process, it’s important to delve deeper into the specific issues faced and the strategies employed to overcome them. One such challenge revolved around the integration of external libraries and dependencies into the project. As a new student to this particular course, I initially struggled to understand the nuances of library integration and the implications it had on the project structure and performance. 

However, through diligent research and experimentation, I gradually gained a deeper understanding of the process, ultimately succeeding in integrating the necessary libraries to enhance the functionality of my application. Furthermore, the debugging process proved to be a significant learning experience. Despite my best efforts to write clean and efficient code, errors and bugs inevitably arose during the development process. Learning to effectively debug and troubleshoot these issues was a crucial skill that I honed throughout the development journey. 

By leveraging tools such as breakpoints, logging, and error messages, I was able to identify and rectify issues in a systematic and efficient manner, ensuring the stability and reliability of the application. So, I was now able to use my buttons efficiently. So, I then decided to put an input digit of 1, thereafter I received an error message for the digit 1 input, which explains that there is no historical figure that died at the age of one, afterwards I then typed 58, which is a valid input, it’s gave information that ‘you are 58 years old which is the same age as Andy Warhol. 

GitHub was utilized as a version control platform throughout the development process of the Historical Demise application. A customized GitHub repository was created to host the project files, including source code and documentation. Through the thoughtful design considerations and the utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions, the app or rather my app offers a seamless and engaging user experience while streamlining the development and deployment process. 

For my app, I decided to use famous singers, dancers, and actors more, because they were not merely entertainers; but they were or even still are cultural ambassadors whose work reflects the zeitgeist of their era. From iconic musicians who revolutionized genres to legendary dancers who pioneered new forms of expression, and actors who brought characters to life on stage and onto the screen, these individuals have shaped the cultural landscape and influenced generations.  

By including singers, dancers, and actors in my history Android Application, I’m also aiming to pay homage to their contributions and highlight their enduring impact on society.  And, beyond their historical significance, singers, dancers and actors hold a special place in my heart due to the profound impact they have had on my life. As a music enthusiast, I have been moved by soul-stirring melodies of singers like Aretha Franklin, and the poetic lyrics of songwriters like Bob Dylan and the electrifying performances of Michael Jackson. Their music has served as a source of comfort, inspiration, and introspection, guiding me through life’s highs and lows. 

  

Through the evolution of my Android application, I have harnessed the power of technology to unlock this capability, enabling users to delve deeper into the lives and legacies of iconic figures across history. The journey began with a simple yet profound instruction: To go about developing an android application that will determine the age of the famous people who have departed. Inspired by my passion for technology, I tried my level best to do this project.  

Central to the evolution of my Android application was the integration of advanced algorithms and data processing techniques to determine the ages of departed celebrities accurately. The evolution of my Android application represents a convergence of technology, innovation, and a passion for history and, or technology. By harnessing the power of technology to determine the ages of famous individuals who have died or departed, the application has transformed into a valuable tool for historical exploration, enabling users to connect with the past in most meaningful and impactful ways. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, I am excited to see how technology will further enrich our understanding of history and illuminate the lives of those who have shaped the world we inhabit today. 

The moment when my Android Application started working and all the buttons were functioning was a joyous milestone that filled me with an overwhelming sense of pride, accomplishment, and also fulfilment. It was just a testament to the power of perseverance, the rewards of hard work, and the sheer joy of seeing a dream come to fruition. As I continue my journey as a student, I carry with me lessons learned from this experience, knowing that no challenge is too great to overcome with determination and dedication.
